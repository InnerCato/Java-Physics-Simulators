# Java Physics Simulator

This repository contains Java-based physics simulation projects. They are kept for archival purposes and are old projects of mine, so expect some mild visual glitches. 
The projects showcase basic physics simulations.

## Projects

### 1. Zero-Gravity Collision Simulation
- Balls move and collide in zero gravity.
- Collisions occur between balls and with walls.
- No gravity effects.
- Folder: `ZeroGCollision/`

### 2. Gravity Collision Simulation
- Balls fall under gravity and collide with each other and the ground.
- Incorporates basic gravity and bouncing mechanics.
- Folder: `GravityAndCollision/`

---

## Features
- Tracks each ball inside an Array.
- 2D ball collision physics simulations.
- Multiple balls with random initial positions and velocities.
- Adjustable number of balls.
- Simple GUI using Java `Swing`.
- Tracks number of collisions in real time.

---

## Usage

### Requirements
- Java
- Built-in Java Swing & AWT

### Running the Simulation
1. Open the project folder (`ZeroGCollision/` or `GravityAndCollision/`) in your IDE or terminal.

2. Run the main class:

```bash
java ZeroGCollision.java
```

or

```bash
java GravityAndCollision.java
```

### Controls

Add balls with + (numpad or keyboard) or left click.

Remove balls with - (numpad or keyboard) or right click.

Hold keys/clicks to add/remove faster.
