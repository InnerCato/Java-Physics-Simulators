# Java Physics Simulator

This repository contains Java-based physics simulation projects. They are kept for archival purposes, so expect them to be a little rough around the edges and scuffed. The projects showcase basic physics simulations.

The projects right now are pretty broken and the balls can sometimes get stuck on each other, but they function in regards to the project scope.
Im keeping it for archival purposes

## Projects

### 1. Zero-Gravity Collision Simulation
- Balls move and collide in zero gravity.
- Collisions occur between balls and with walls.
- No gravity effects.
- Folder: `BouncingBalls/`

### 2. Gravity Collision Simulation
- Balls fall under gravity and collide with each other and the ground.
- Incorporates basic gravity and bouncing mechanics.
- Folder: `PhysicsBalls/`

---

## Features
- Tracks each ball inside an Array.
- 2D ball collision physics simulations.
- Multiple balls with random initial positions and velocities.
- Adjustable number of balls.
- Simple GUI using Java `Swing`.
- Tracks number of collisions in real time.

---

## Usage

### Requirements
- Java 8 or later
- No additional libraries required (uses built-in Java Swing & AWT).

### Running the Simulation
1. Open the project folder (`BouncingBalls/` or `PhysicsBalls/`) in your IDE or terminal.

2. Run the main class:

```bash
java ZeroGCollision.java
```

or

```bash
java GravityAndCollision.java
```

### Controls

    Add balls with + (numpad or keyboard) or left click.

    Remove balls with - (numpad or keyboard) or right click.

    Hold keys/clicks to add/remove multiple balls.

## Notes

    Old and scuffed projects; contains quirks and visual glitches.

    Kept for learning/archival purposes.

    Feel free to explore, modify, or use as a starting point for more polished simulations.
